Project based on The Odin Project's "Landing Page" exercise, looking to consolidate HTML and CSS knowledge into a prototype-page built from scratch.

Upon completion of this project the main things I have taken from it -


-How to start a project from scratch (i.e. start with the html, then the css, go change the html as needed and take it by parts);

-The browser's element inspector is the best tool to use while building a website;

-Looking at elements individually and figuring out how they fit in eachother (what flex containters there are and what flex-items are also flex containters) before you even write the html is key to having some smooth sailing;

-There is a lot of space to get better at providing a more compact CSS code, as at the moment nearly every class' properties are addressed individually and there is very little grouping - I suspect this is one of the main areas that differentiate a good web developer from a mediocre.
